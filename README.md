# cs231n Assignments Solutions and Reports - Spring 2020

Recently, I have been taking the course of Stanford [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), and I will keep updating study reports and assignments solutions in this repo. [Here](https://github.com/cs231n/cs231n.github.io) is the official repo.
